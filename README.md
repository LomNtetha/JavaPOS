The JavaPOS (Java for Point Of Sale) standard committee was formed by a collection of retail vendors 
and end users to examine the ways in which these Java advantages could best be exploited in the retail environment.  

The original JavaPOS programming standard (v1.2) was the end result of ten months of effort by this committee. 
It was followed by JavaPOS v1.3, which defined Java interfaces for three additional retail POS devices (Fiscal Printer, PIN Pad and Remote Order Display), 
and JavaPOS v1.4, which added the Credit Authorization Terminal (CAT) interface requested by Japanese retailers.
